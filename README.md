# 📖 Overview

Modern ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines frequently encounter failures caused by corrupted data, infrastructure issues, schema mismatches, or network interruptions. Traditional recovery methods require manual intervention, increasing downtime and operational costs.

The **AI-Driven Serverless ETL Recovery System** provides an automated, intelligent, and highly scalable recovery mechanism that detects failures, identifies their causes, predicts anomalies, and automatically re-executes failed workflows without human intervention.

Built entirely on **AWS Serverless Architecture**, the system minimizes infrastructure management while ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency.

# 🎯 Objectives

* Automate ETL failure detection
* Recover failed workflows without manual intervention
* Reduce operational downtime
* Predict anomalies using Machine Learning
* Build a fully serverless cloud-native solution
* Improve reliability of enterprise data pipelines

# ⚙ Workflow

1. Data is uploaded to Amazon S3.
2. EventBridge detects the upload event.
3. Lambda triggers the workflow.
4. Step Functions orchestrate the ETL pipeline.
5. AWS Glue transforms the incoming data.
6. AI model analyzes workflow health.
7. If a failure occurs:

   * Detect error
   * Identify root cause
   * Retry execution
   * Resume from checkpoint
   * Rollback if required
8. Successfully processed data is stored in S3.
9. Athena and QuickSight generate reports and dashboards.
